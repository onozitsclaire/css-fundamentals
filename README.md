CSS Fundamentals Project #1

This was a project in an HTML/CSS projects course off of Udemy that allowed me to practice utilizing different containers in HTML, for CSS styling. It also had me use both class (.) and ID (#) selectors for my declarations. I focused on color and font-size.

Before I walked through the solution to the video, I attempted this on my own. A few notes for myself about things I messed up on:

- I did not correctly make two containers, which would have been div class="container" for each section
- I messed up on the header ID selector, where it should have been h1 id="title" and then the name of each container
- I did not correctly write the CSS code for the paragraph container. You can technically write it as all p entities within the HTML document, but for the purposes of the exercise, I was meant to make it specifically for each container within the exercise.

A few things I did correctly:

- Created the folder and files
- Created a GitHub repository and uploaded the files to it (I am still getting an error but hope to get this resolved this week)
- Shortcut the boilerplate information onto the HTML file correctly
- Linked a CSS stylesheet in an HTML file correctly
- Set up the majority of my HTML code correctly, including making two separate containers, correctly tagging a div class and a span class, using a header, and the p tag correctly, and also autofilling the lorem ipsum font into the document
- Correctly formatted the .icon class selector on the CSS style sheet (when I showed live view before I started following the video, my code was correct)
- Made an attempt to fill in the rest of the CSS sheet and the HTML to the best of my ability, before I reviewed the answers.

Take Aways from this lesson: Making containers for the purpose of streamlining CSS stylesheets, differences between a class (.) an ID (#) an element selector (p, div, etc.) and a universal selector (*), basic understanding of CSS formatting, how to code color and font-size, as well as the opening/closing brackets, and comments within the CSS document, ways to streamline the process (copy and pasting, using the Command+D shortcut with text highlighted to replace all the instances of a specific piece of text within the document, using Lorem ipsum in a document, shortcut for adding comments, the importance of practicing on my own first.
